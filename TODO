* add logging
* rewrite makefile
* add REPL console to the loader itself, use pthread.h
* actually test things
* actually get things to work
* add configuration options (?)

brainstorming:
add a function that uses va_list to let the user call basically any function available to dlsym
add loaded functions to a tree, search that before loading them again unless that takes longer
or just use a more specific (for each function) way of storing data that'd work like an address.
