EEex Mac Loader
===============

EEex loader for Mac OSX. See source for copyright details.


About EEex
----------

EEex is an executable extender for the EEs. This allows you to modify
the game engine in-memory, allowing you to do stuff like TobEx did,
just capitalised on a different letter and a decade later.

You can check for full compatibility notes and information on how
EEex itself works elsewhere, since this is just the Mac version of the
loader that EEex requires to work.


Launching the game
------------------

EEex.sh is used to launch the game and load the EEex library that's
needed to inject code into the game executable. It needs to be in the
same directory as the game executable and needs to be marked as an
executable itself.

You can drag-and-drop EEex.sh on your dock and even rename it into
something fancier if you so please, as well as changing the icon et
cetera. Just make sure the previous conditions are being met otherwise
it'll yell some fancy garbage at you.


EEex authors
------------

As you might have hopefully noticed, I'm not the only person behind
EEex. Credit for EEex goes to Bubb, and fearless for the Windows
version of the Loader. Many thanks to both of them for their help and
of course, their work on EEex.
